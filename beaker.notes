### beaker vagrant can't ssh into a machine ###
Can't get  beaker to work because the alogirthms for ssh don't match.  
Windows winrm is only using ssh-dss:

Add the following to the windows node in the nodeset:

    ssh:
      append_all_supported_algorithms: true

Beaker merges the ssh: options to provide a call to Net::SSH.   To see other options NetSSH uses  see  the gem net-ssh-<version>/lib/net/ssh.rb

it tells you the options the gem will accept.
