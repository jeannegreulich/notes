# In order to log in as the postgres you need to add postgres user to the /etc/security/access.conf file to give it login access.


To remove and readd the puppetdb do the folllowing:

Disconnect the puppetdb from puppet sever (instructions in the simp docs.)

puppet agent --disable
vi /etc/security/access.conf 
  add line 
+:postgres:ALL

su postgres
dropdb puppetdb
#Log into postgresql and list databases to see if puppet db is gone
psql
> \list
> \q
exit
# you should be back as root
#remove extraneous data outside of puppet db
cd /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetdb/
rm -rf *
ls -la /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/
# Make sure puppetdb directory still exists had perms 770 and is owned by puppetdb:puppetdb.

puppet agent --enable 
puppet agent -t

# The puppetdb server should be restored.
