Debug for rsyslog:

stop the service and set:

export RSYSLOG_DEBUG="Debug"
export RSYSLOG_DEBUGLOG="/var/log/rsyslog.debug"

if you want detailed certificate checking then in your global.conf file add the line:

global(debug.gnutls="10" debug.logFile="/var/log/rsyslogdebug")


now start rsyslog from the command line with 
     rsyslog -dn


(this will print it all to the screen and save the out put to the defined files above if you want to search it all.)

NOTE Setting RSYSLOG_DEBUG is processed earlier in the startup than command line
                     options (i.e. -d) and as such enables earlier debugging
                     output. Mutually exclusive with DebugOnDemand
