add kernel parameters ima_appraise_tcb and ima_appraise=fix

had to download the ima-evm-utils package
https://www.rpmfind.net/linux/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/i/ima-evm-utils-1.0-2.el7.x86_64.rpm
it doesn't seem to be in the extras/base/updates repos.
install this package.

yum install attr package to view the ima attributes on a file.

run
find / \( -fstype rootfs -o -fstype ext4 \) -type f -uid 0 -exec evmctl ima_hash '{}' > /dev/null \;

to add the ima attributes to the files.

to see if they are there do:

getfattr -m . -d <filename>

------
now change the kernel parameter ima_appraise=fix to ima_appraise=enforce and
reboot.

-----------
I did that and it rebooted but I could only log in as root at the console and I could not
read the log files.

--------
I tried to update the ima policy in /sys/kernel/security/ima/policy using the
tpm module but I get an error that it can not write to that file.

Two feature tickets have been entered to REDHAT NSA
1) Clear the memory cache.  Once You enter a file measurement into the cache it stays,
   even if your policy says don't measure it and even if the file is not there anylonger.
   This can hog memory.  If you reboot it reloads this whole file.
2) Allow a reload of the policy without rebooting and log it to the audit log. The securityfs
   file system only allows you to write to it at boot time.  This means if you change and update the policy
   you need to reboot.  UNIX people don't like to reboot.  This can be a considerable problem on clustered systems
   with lots of nodes.
