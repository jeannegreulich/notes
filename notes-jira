Once you have pushed you changes to your github repository with the correct Git Commit message, create a pull request from git hub to gerrit.
-  Make sure you  use the correct branch in the simp repository.  (It defaults to master but master is not always the main branch in SIMP)

When the pull request is comlete go to gerrit  GitHUB -> repositries  replication ->

select simp in the repositories drop down (because it that is where you sent your changes.)
- it takes it a while but a list of changes should pop up.
-when you see the list select the check box next to your  change
- the select the big green box at the top that says Next.



How to determine what puppet modules/classes are installed on a puppet server:
  /var/lib/puppet/classes.txt  (This is a list classes instaled by puppet on this server.)

-----------------------------------------------
grep -rl --exclude-dir='.git'  <search term>  

-----------------------------------------------------

Update a repository already pushed to Gerrit once:

pull from your github repo.
edit as needed.
add your ssh repo as remote
  git remote add <name> <ssh access from github>
  git remote add jeanne git@github.com:jeannegreulich/pupmod-simp-ssh.git
git commit --amend
  add to the botom of yor commit message a line from gerrit with change id:
  Change-Id I029e11ba01a1e9d0f15052bffa84d7ea1ef00fcb
      and make sure you leave one blank line between that and the comments.
      You can get the change id by logging into gerrit, select "my", select changes and then
       find the change you submitted earlier.  Click on it and it opens a page with
      a lot of information and on the left hand side about midway down is the change id.
 now save the commit
git push --force <where> <what>
  where will be your remote ssh repo you added earlier
  what is the branch you are working on
  Yep you need force or it gives you an error that you are out of sync.
Now when you go to github yo should see your changes.  Now go back to Gerrit and pull the updates
   Log into gerrit, select "Github", select Pull requests, find your pull request
   and select next until it  has updated.

 How to pull changes from gerrit:

 1)  In git set up remotes to point to gerrit.  You can do this by adding the following line to the alias section of your git config and running the alais:
 [alias]
   rag = "!f() { origin_url=`git config --get remote.origin.url`; if [ -z \"${origin_url}\" ]; then url=`git config --get remote.upstream.url`; else url=$origin_url; fi; reponame=`basename $url`; git remote rm gerrit 2>/dev/null || true; git remote add gerrit \"ssh://jeannegreulich@review.gerrithub.io:29418/simp/${reponame}\" 2>/dev/null; }; f"

-clone the git repository you want:

git clone http://github.com/simp/pupmod-foreman
cd pupmod-forman
git rag    (This is running the alias to create your remote.)

2) Now use git review to see if any changes exist:

git review -l

3) If there are any changes it will list them with the number of the change in the far left.  Use that number to download the changes:

git review  -d <the number>

Now the changes have been pulled from gerrit to your clone.

Query for JIRA:

project = SIMP AND status changed to Closed after -7d  AND resolution = Done

(Select the issues icon from left and then search issues.)  
(Issues is an icon on the left that looks like a check box)
