-installed new puppet server
 pointing to its own ldap,dns
-copied over dns info and added my server to old dns.
-tested moving dns to new one on a few to see if I knew what I wa doing.
-dumped ldap and restored.
  -shutdown slap on old server
  -slapcat -f /path/to/the/slapd.conf -l backup.ldif
  - change hiera variable for password on new
  - shutdown new
  - slapadd -v -c -l backup.ldif -f /path/to/the/slapd.conf
  -restart slapd
  - Note it didn't work and I manually reset the password using slappasswd
    and ldapmodify.  But I think it might just have been that I forgot to
    restart sssd also.

  LAN.)
