Do echo 1 >> /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_exit_inotify_add_watch/enable to enable tracing of watch adds;
Do cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_enabled to make sure it's set to 1 and if it isn't do echo 1 >> /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_enabled;
Restart the processes with inotify instances (determined as described in Petr Uzel's answer) that you suspect of creating a lot of watches; and
Read the file /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace to watch how many watches are created and by which processes.


lsof | grep -i inotify

#To fix out of space when running systemctl or tail -f
Permanent solution (preserved across restarts) Adding line:

fs.inotify.max_user_watches=1048576

to:

/etc/sysctl.conf

fixed the limit value permanently (even between restarts).

then do a

sysctl -p
