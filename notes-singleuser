When the boot menu comes up, hit e to select the option.

in the linux16 (linux or linuxefi depending on system) line replace

ro   with rw init=/sysroot/bin/sh
rd.shell=0 with rd.shell=1

Then hit control-x and you will boot into single user mode.


To get more info on boot you can remove "rhgb  quiet" entirely or just the quiet.  Gives
different amount of info.  I am not sure the difference.

or add rd.debug


Here is a good page to decscribe the options.
