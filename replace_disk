#For each device run 
smartctl -a <dev> | grep overview

#This will show you what disks are failing.  (I have a script on tastybolt in iava_project that can be run.)

# Now you know what disk is failing do the following

# Lets say /dev/sdb is failing on a RAID 5.

# Get the Serial number from the disk so you know you removed
# the right one.

hdparm -i /dev/sdb 

# Remove the disk from any arrays it is in.
# This will show you what partions are in a RAID
mdadm --misc --detail /dev/md126

#Say it says /dev/sdb2 is part of /dev/md126

mdadm --manage /dev/md126 --fail /dev/sdb2
mdadm --manage /dev/md126 --remove /dev/sdb2
mdadm --misc --detail /dev/md126

# When you run the detail it should show the sdb partition as removed
# Do the above for all raid drives.  And remove any partitions
# from sdb from them.

# Shutdown the system and remove the failed drive and replace it.
# Reboot the system.

# Note sgdisk is installed with yum install gdisk.
#Copy the partition table from a good disk to the newly replaced disk
sgdisk -R /dev/sdb /dev/sda
# Now update the UUID for the new drive in the partition table
sgdisk -G /dev/sdb

# Now add the new disk back into the RAID partitions
mdadm --manage /dev/md126 --add /dev/sdb2
# Do this for all the raid drives.

# When you run

mdadm --misc --detail /dev/md126


# You should see that the new drive is added and is rebuilding.
