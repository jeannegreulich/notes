Building the ISO:

1) Build the ISO in a local directory not your home directory.  The home dir is remote mounted and adds additional time copying large amounts of files over the network

2)you can build two at once just do it in different directories.

3)
  - create the directory you are building in.
  - cd to that directory and clone simp-core
  -cd simp-core
  - copy over the OS cd from /srv/net/ISO  into
    the simp-core directory.
  - run the rake:   rake build:auto[<iso dir>,<version>]  5.1.X or 5.1.0-2   or 4.2.3 or 4.2.X  , 6.X are available now

4) If you are in simp-core and run rake -D build:auto  it will list out all the parameters and environment
   vairiables you can set to modify the build.
       SIMP_BUILD_bundle=no


When it can't find the source rpms, remove simp-rake-helpers gem and reinstall, you probably have an old version and someone
didn't update the version.

Also remove /var/cache  it seems to be have downloaded a bad repomd.xml and for some reason yum clean all does not work. When it tries to install the
mock environment it is failing.
  (To find this I ran this command in simp-adapter directory
    SIMP_BUILD_version=6.0.1-RC1.el7.centos rake pkg:rpm[/var/jmg/6.0.1-7/simp-core/build/distributions/CentOS/7/x86_64/mock.cfg,true,false]
  and them saw that this command:
    /usr/bin/yum --installroot /var/lib/mock/simp-centos-7-x86_64-simp-adapter__jgreulich/root/ --releasever 7 install @buildsys-build --setopt=tsflags=nocontexts
  was failing)

------
Error can't find template means the link to template in rake helpers simp6. is wrong

-----
Error creating gpg key:
Not so fun fact about building an ISO:  As part of building a dev ISO, we generate a GPG key for it.  If the --homedir parameter passed to gpg-agent is too long, the agent won't start and emits the following error message (which is of course suppressed by simp-rake-helpers):
   gpg-agent[19447]: name of socket too long
The following path was a few characters too long:
/var/opt/enemsick/lrep/simp-core-SIMP-3458-el7/build/distributions/CentOS/7/x86_64/build_keys/dev
