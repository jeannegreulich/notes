In the inspec-profile-disa_stig-el7 module identify any tests that pertain to your module and
add a susbsystem tag  to identify that you want to run the tests against the module you are
configuring.  In this case I am using the tag "ssh":
ie for control/V-72235.rb
...
  tag "cci": "CCI-002421"
  tag "nist": ["SC-8 (1)", "Rev_4"]
  tag "cci": "CCI-002422"
  tag "nist": ["SC-8 (2)", "Rev_4"]
  tag "subsystems": ["ssh"]
  tag "check": "Verify SSH is loaded and active with the following command:

  # systemctl status sshd
   sshd.service - OpenSSH server daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service; enabled)
....
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the simp module that will run the test (pupmod-simp-ssh in this example:
(I copied the files over from the pam module but had to put some fixes in.)

1) copy the spec/fixtures/inspec_profiles
   directory.  This contains the main inspec control test.
   You need to update this to point to the tests you want from a perviously done
   test.  (Can we make this a generic module and just pass in the tag?)

2) Update the test  spec/fixtures/inspec_profiles/RedHat-7-disa_stig/controls/00_Control_Selector.rb
  to check for the correct tag used above.

3) Add the inspec module to the fixtures file:

      disa_stig-el7-baseline:
      repo: https://github.com/simp/inspec-profile-disa_stig-el7
      branch:  master
      target: spec/fixtures/inspec_deps/inspec_profiles/profiles

Note: you need simp-beaker-helpers 1.10.5 or later.  That is what copies these
modules to the correct place for the acceptance tests to work.

4) Copy the spec test suite over:
   spec/acceptance/suites/compliance

NOTE: I had to make some hacks in the test themselves to make sure thatbeaker helpers
could copy files over once ssh was locked down so you might want to stick with the 
pam tests for a start.  How ever I also added the simp-dependancy repo to the nodeset
and you will probably need that for haveged and other dependancies if you module
needs them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also had to add settings to the pupmod-simp-compliance_markup module.
