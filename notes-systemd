When systemctl list-unit-files times out it is a known problem (actually with dbus)

see: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/1961

It appears sesions are being abandoned.

To fix you can try:

systemctl restart dbus-org.freedesktop.login1.service
systemctl restart systemd-logind.service
systemctl daemon-reload

It should clear out the files in /run/systemd/system.   (There will be a ton of 
session-*-scope files in there from abandoned sessions.

if that doesn't work try:


systemctl | grep "abandoned" | grep -e "-[[:digit:]]" | sed "s/\.scope.*/.scope/" | xargs systemctl stop


If you are desperate remove the session files from /run/systemd/system as directed in the github link above

or I guess reboot.

---------------
The dbus issues makes it so that you must reboot your system after  updating systemd:
