Create profile module for configuring snmpd
1) Installation:
 -install snmpd deamon
    set defaults for user auth mode:
       -usm (make this OS spec since Centos 7 will in future be able to use TLS/DTLS
       -priv
 -ask if to install utils (client) 
    default no although we will need it for testing
    since we are not setting up trap.
 -configure defaultscreate directories
 -determine what packages are to be installed: snmpd, utils, trap
 - configure system setting in snmpd.local.conf
 -system name,location,contact that stuff that is local to the machine
 -disable v1 and v2
 - audit and selinux? Does SNMP have its own selinux context? Haven't figured that one out yet.
 -  Logging - it looks like where it is logged it set up via parameters to
    snmpd.  Some defaults are set in snmpd.conf
 - create types for:
    security model (usm, tls,...)
    security level (noauth, auth. priv)
    oid
2)configure iptables & tcp wrappers
  - set the agent addresses and iptables accordingly.
  - snmp module defaults to local only -
     - use array to add interfaces and set up IP Tables
   (pass this to snmp before install or create a file in simp dir?)
3) access: For now use USM (tls/stls will be looked at later. Note net-snmp version 5.5 on Centos 6.9 does not even handle TLS/SSH etc.)
v3: 
   create/configure users
   create an access.conf file in simp directory that contains
     views/access/groups.
   check for fips and son't allow MD5, DES if enabled.
   create 2 users
      -read only with access to system by default or shoudl it be a read everything
       user?  (look at simp snmpd module for defaults)
      -read write with access to system and read to everything
      - system OIDS seem to be defined
           - .1.3.6.1.2.1.1 (System -
           - .1.3.6.1.2.1.25 (Host -stuff like what is installed, etc)

4)Create a monitoring.conf in simp directory tosetup defaults for monitoring
   (look at pupmod-simp-snmpd to see what was done in that module)
5)configure rsync to sync mib dirs
6)configure rsync to sync dlmod dirs
    may need to do this before calling snmp but check it out.
    see if creating dlmod.conf in simp directory will work. 
    (I have nto found modules to test with)

98) Document the usage in the README and the Read the docs

99) Unit tests

100) Acceptance tests
