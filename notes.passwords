Passwords must be 15 char at least, have big, little, number and special. And have no
more than three of each in a row:
It also has a list of known words you can't use.
Example of on that works:
  P@ssw0rdP@ssw0rd

If your initial password is to simple it will not let you change it.  You get a token manipulation error when
you try to change your password.
